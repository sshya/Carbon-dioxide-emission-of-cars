# Carbon-dioxide-emission-of-cars
This project uses a scikit-learn library to implement Simple linear regression, Multiple Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression. Includes a dataset of fuel consumption and Carbon dioxide emission of cars. A model was created using the training set, evaluated model using the test set, and finally used the model to predict unknown value.
